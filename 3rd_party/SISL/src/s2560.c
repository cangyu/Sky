*
* PURPOSE    : Evaluate the Frenet Frame (t,n,b) of a curve
*              at a given parameter value, from the right hand side.
*
*
*
* INPUT      : curve    - Pointer to the curve.
*              parvalue - The parameter value at which to compute
*                         the Frenet Frame.
*
*
*
* INPUT/OUTPUT : leftknot - Pointer to the interval in the knot vector
*                        where ax is located. If et is the knot vector,
*                        the relation
*
*                          et[ileft] < parvalue <= et[ileft+1]
*
*                        should hold. (If parvalue == et[ik-1] then ileft
*                        should be ik-1. Here in is the number of B-spline
*                        coefficients.)
*                        If ileft does not have the right value upon
*                        entry to the routine, its value will be changed
*                        to the value satisfying the above condition.
*
*
*
* OUTPUT     : derive   - Double array of dimension [3*idim]
*                       containing the position and derivative vectors.
*                       (idim is the number of components of each B-spline
*                       coefficient, i.e. the dimension of the Euclidean
*                       space in which the curve lies.)
*                       These vectors are stored in the following order:
*                       First the idim components of the position vector,
*                       then the idim components of the tangent vector,
*                       then the idim components of the second derivative
*                       vector, and so on.
*
*         (t,n,b) - The Frenet Frame (in 3D) computed. Each of the vectors
*                   (t,n,b) are of dim. 3, and the data are
*                   stored like this: tx(parvalue), ty(parvalue), tz(parvalue).
*
*         p     - 3D curve posistions at parvalue.
*
*              jstat  - Status messages
*                                         > 0      : Warning.
*                                         = 0      : Ok.
*                                         < 0      : Error.
*
*
* METHOD     : The derivatives are evaluated from the right hand
*              side by  s1221(), and the Frenet Frame are evaluated by s2561()
