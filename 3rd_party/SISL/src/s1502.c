* PURPOSE    : Find all intersections between a curve and an elliptic cone.
*
*
*
* INPUT      : pc1    - Pointer to the curve.
*              base   - Base point of cone, center of elliptic base.
*              norm   - Direction of cone axis, default pointing from
*                       basepoint towards top point of the cone.
*              axisA  - One of the two ellipse axis vectors.
*              alpha  - The opening angle of the cone at axisA
*              ratio  - The ratio of axisA to axisB
*              idim   - Dimension of the space in which the elliptic cone
*                       lies. idim should be equal to three.
*              aepsco - Computational resolution.
*              aepsge - Geometry resolution.
*
*
*
* OUTPUT     : *jpt   - Number of single intersection points.
*              gpar   - Array containing the parameter values of the
*                       single intersection points in the parameter
*                       interval of the curve. The points lie continuous.
*                       Intersection curves are stored in wcurve.
*              *jcrv  - Number of intersection curves.
*              wcurve  - Array containing descriptions of the intersection
*                       curves. The curves are only described by points
*                       in the parameter interval. The curve-pointers points
*                       to nothing. (See description of Intcurve
*                       in intcurve.dcl).
*              jstat  - status messages
*                                         > 0      : warning
*                                         = 0      : ok
*                                         < 0      : error
*
*
* METHOD     : The vertices of the curve is put into the equation of the
*              cone achieving a curve in the one-dimentional space.
*              The zeroes of this curve is found.
*
* REFERENCES : Main routine written by Mike Floater, SI, 1990.
*
* CALLS      : sh1502, s6err.
*
* WRITTEN BY : Christophe Rene Birkeland, SINTEF, 93-06.
* Revised by : Paal Fugelli, SINTEF, Oslo, Norway, Nov. 1994. Changed header
*              text to reflect that the routine only handles 3D input.
