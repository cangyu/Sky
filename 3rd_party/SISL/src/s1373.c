* PURPOSE    : Find all intersections between a curve and a cone.
*
*
*
* INPUT      : pc1    - Pointer to the curve.
*              etop   - Top point on cone.
*              eaxis  - Point on the cone axis (other than top point).
*              econe  - SISLPoint on cone surface.
*              idim   - Dimension of the space in which the cone
*                       lies. idim should be equal to three.
*              aepsco - Computational resolution.
*              aepsge - Geometry resolution.
*
*
*
* OUTPUT     : *jpt   - Number of single intersection points.
*              gpar   - Array containing the parameter values of the
*                       single intersection points in the parameter
*                       interval of the curve. The points lie continuous.
*                       Intersection curves are stored in wcurve.
*              *jcrv  - Number of intersection curves.
*              wcurve  - Array containing descriptions of the intersection
*                       curves. The curves are only described by points
*                       in the parameter interval. The curve-pointers points
*                       to nothing. (See description of Intcurve
*                       in intcurve.dcl).
*              jstat  - status messages
*                                         > 0      : warning
*                                         = 0      : ok
*                                         < 0      : error
*
*
* METHOD     : The vertices of the curve is put into the equation of the
*              cone achieving a curve in the one-dimentional space.
*              The zeroes of this curve is found.
