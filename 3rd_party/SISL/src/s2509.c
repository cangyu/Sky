*  PURPOSE      :  To compute the second Mehlum curvature M(u,v) of a surface 
*                  for given values (u,v). This is a lower level routine, used
*                  for evaluation of many M(u,v)'s.
*  INPUT        :
*          surf     - Pointer to the surface to evaluate.
*          ider     - Only implemented for ider=0 (derivative order).
*       derive      - Array containing derivatives from routine s1421().
*                     Size = idim*6.
*       normal      - Array containing the normal from routine s1421().
*                     Size = 3.
*
*  OUTPUT       :
*       mehlum      - The second order Mehlum curvature of the surface.
*        jstat      - Status messages
*
*                         = 0 : Ok.
*                         < 0 : Error.
*
*  METHOD       :  The second order Mehlum curvature is given by
*
*                      M(u,v) = 3(eG-2fF+gE)^2/8(EG-F*F)^3 - 
*                               (eg-f*f)/2(EG-F*F)^2.
*
*                  The variables E,F,G,e,f and g
*                  are the coefficients of the first and second fundamental form.
*                  They are given by: e = <N,Xuu>, f = <N,Xuv>, g = <N,Xvv>,
*                  E = <Xu,Xu>, F = <Xu,Xv> and G = <Xv,Xv>.

*-
*  CALLS        :
*
*  LIMITATIONS  :
*                (i) If the surface is degenerated (not regular) at the point
*                    (u,v), it makes no sense to speak about the Mehlum
*                    M(u,v).
*               (ii) If the surface is closed to degenerate, the Mehlum
*                    M(u,v) can be numerical unstable.
*              (iii) The dimension of the space in which the surface lies must
*                    be 1,2 or 3, if not, jstat = -105 is returned.
