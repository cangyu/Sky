* PURPOSE    : Find all intersections between a tensor-product surface
*              and a cylinder.
*
*
*
* INPUT      : ps1      - Pointer to surface.
*              epoint   - SISLPoint on the axis of the cylinder.
*              edirec   - The direction vector of the axis of the cylinder.
*              aradius  - Radius of the cylinder.
*              idim     - Dimension of the space in which the cylinder lies.
*              aepsco   - Computational resolution.
*              aepsge   - Geometry resolution.
*                                                                        
*
*
* OUTPUT     : *jpt   - Number of single intersection points.
*              gpar   - Array containing the parameter values of the
*                       single intersection points in the parameter
*                       plane of the surface. The points lie continuous. 
*                       Intersection curves are stored in wcurve.
*              *jcrv  - Number of intersection curves.
*              wcurve  - Array containing descriptions of the intersection
*                       curves. The curves are only described by points
*                       in the parameter plane. The curve-pointers points
*                       to nothing. (See description of Intcurve
*                       in intcurve.dcl).
*              jstat  - status messages  
*                                         > 0      : warning
*                                         = 0      : ok
*                                         < 0      : error
*
*
* METHOD     : The vertices of the surface are put into the equation of the
*              cylinder achieving a surface in the one-dimentional space.
*              Then the zeroes of this surface is found.
