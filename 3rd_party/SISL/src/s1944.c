*********************************************************************

* PURPOSE    : To set up the normal equations for solving the linear
*              system ea*x=ed in a weighted least squares sense. The
*              least squares problem stems from the problem of approximating
*              the spline with knot vector et and B-spline coefficients 
*              ed from the subspace generated by the knot vector etau
*              which is a subsequence of et. The aim is to minimize a
*              weighted 2-norm of the coefficients of the difference between
*              a spline from the spline space generated by etau and the
*              given spline in the spline space gernerated by et expressed
*              in the latter space.
* 
* INPUT      : etau   - Real array of length (in+ik) containing the  
*                       knot vector of the approximating space.
*	       ik     - The order of the spline space.
*              in     - The dimension of the spline space corresponding
*                       to etau.
*              idim   - The dimension of the geometry space.
*              et     - Real array of length (im+ik) containing the refined
*                       knot vector.
*              ed     - Real array of length (im*idim) containing the B-spline
*                       coefficients of the spline to be approximated.
*              im     - The dimension of the spline space corresponding to et.
*              inlc   - Number of columns of corner element.
*              inlr   - Number of rows of corner element.
*              inorm  - Number of rows of corner element of normal equations.
*              ea     - Real array of dimension (im*ik) containing 
*                       the B-spline refinement matrix from the knot vector
*                       etau to the knot vector et. This matrix has
*                       dimension im*in but since at most
*                       ik entries are nonzero in each row, it can
*                       be stored in a im*ik array together
*                       with two integer arrays indicating the position
*                       of the first and last nonzero elements in each
*                       row, and a matrix representing corner elements if
*                       the spline is periodic.
*              ew1    - Corner element originating from periodicity.
*                       Size inlr*inlc.
*              nfirst - Integer array of dimension (im) containing 
*                       pointers to the first nonzero element of each row 
*                       of the B-spline refinement matrix from etau to et.
*              nlast  - Integer array of dimension (im) containing 
*                       pointers to the last nonzero element of each row 
*                       of the B-spline refinement matrix from etau to et.
*
* 
* OUTPUT     : eb     - Real array of dimension (in*ik) containing the 
*                       band part of the coefficient matrix of the normal 
*                       equations. This is really a 
*                       in*in matrix but since each row of ea
*                       only has at most ik nonzero elements and eb
*                       essentially is of the form eb = ea(tr)*ea, it is
*                       easy to see that eb is a band matrix of band with
*                       at most ik. Since eb also is symmetric it is enough
*                       to store the elements below and on the diagonal.
*                       This is done by storing the diagonal element of row
*                       i in eb(i*ik+ik-1), and then letting d2sta[i] indicat
*                       the position of the first nonzero element in row i of eb.
*              ew2    - Corner element of the coefficient matrix of the normal
*                       equations. Size inlc*in.
*              n2sta  - Integer array of length (in*idim) containing pointers to
*                       the first nonzero elements of the in rows of eb.
*              ec     - Real array of lengh (in*idim) containing the right
*                       hand side of the normal equations (or really the
*                       idim right hand sides).
*              jstat      - status messages  
*                                         > 0      : warning
*                                         = 0      : ok
*                                         < 0      : error
