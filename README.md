Parametric Modeling Tool for Aircraft Design.

#Description
The program is currently devoted to BWB(a.k.a. Blended-Wing-Body) design,
and aims at generating models ready for CFD calculation and optimization.

#Implementation
Generally speaking, the STL model is composed of thousands of triangles, so we just need to craft out
all the geometric elements like curves, lines and faces manually, and the discrete them into triangles.
